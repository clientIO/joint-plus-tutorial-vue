# joint-plus-tutorial-vue2

This git repository is intended for instructional purposes. It is the Vue version 2 source code that accompanies a JointJS+ blog post "Integration with Vue" which can be found [here](https://resources.jointjs.com/tutorial/vue-ts).

### Prerequisites  

To run the following code, you will need a [JointJS+ license](https://www.jointjs.com/license) that comes with the JointJS+ installable package file `rappid.tgz`.

### Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- git

#### Setup

Clone this repository.

```
git clone git@github.com:clientIO/rappid-tutorial-vue3.git
```

Change into the `rappid-tutorial-vue3` directory.

For this tutorial, you need to place your own `rappid.tgz` file in the root directory.

When that is completed, you can install the dependencies.
